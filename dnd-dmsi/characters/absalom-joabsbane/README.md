## Rise of Joab Dragonsbane

Joab Dragonsbane, born Westmont, was the famed dark lord of Dambrath. Unlike most dark lords, Westmont's ambitions were higher than the domination of all life. Inspired by the legends of Tharizdun, Westmont hoped to trigger another Dawn War by amassing an army of dragons and waking the surviving Dawn Titans.

Among his followers he was lauded as a long-awaited god who would ascend to tear down the existing deities from their thrones. 

Absalom, who had experienced magical supremacy during his [visit to Thay](#visit-to-thay), quickly fell in with the largely magical followers of Westmont. Absalmon's stature in the group grew swiftly, due in large part to his powerful conjuration skills that were the cause of many a dragon's downfall. While the epithet "dragonsbane" was ultimately awarded to Westmont, many historians have noted that it was largely campaigns orchestrated and executed by Absalom Dason that earned Westmont this title. 

As Absalom grew in power, both arcane and political, his lust for dragons' blood grew. This ran in direct conflict with Westmont's ultimate goal of stirring the dragons, through fear or awe, into an alliance to begin a war with the gods. Complicating the matter further was Absalom's deepening romance with Westmont. Among those in Westmont's inner circle it was often whispered that the dragons would be lost in the bedroom, not on the battlefield.

After several years of continued dragon hunting and growing interpersonal conflict between the dark lord and Absalom, several of Westmont's other lieutenants began urging him to cast Absalom out of their fold. Following the siege of Cathyr, for which Absalom was absent in favor of a red dragon hunt, Absalom was banished by Westmont to the North.

Despite the exile of his most powerful lieutenant, Westmont's power in the region grew evermore. It was shortly after Absalom's exile that the small folk of Dambrath, as well as those in neighboring regions, began referring to Westmont as Dragonsbane.

## Exile in Thay

Absalom, still bent on power and bloodlust turned his sights to Thay. It is likely that his intentions were to become a Red Wizard and ultimately, a Zulkir. For one reason or another, this never happened. In fact, its presumed that he quickly became an enemy of the Red Wizards. It is clear that his time in Thay began to shift his alignment from Lawful Evil to Lawful Neutral.

Sometime during the three years that he spent in Thay, Absalom married Onima, a slafe trafficked by the Red Wizards whom he had helped to win her freedom. His marriage to her soon prompted their departure from Thay, and the began a slow journey south to Halruaa.

### An Encounter with Asgorath

At some point on his journey south, Absalom recalls an encounter with the primordial god Asgorath. While its veracity is questioned by most scholars of both religion and arcana, it nevertheless seems to have made a profound impact on the trajectory of Absalom's life.

> Much of the encounter is now hazy, a fault of age. But I recall distinctly that Onima and I were staying with a family in Red Haven. We were interviewing various hamlets as potential settlements for my wife and I. We wanted some place safe enough that our children could make it into adolescence, but harsh enough that we wouldn't raise pansies. It all seems so silly now of course. [...] Later that evening I took a stroll on the docks as I was apt to do. It helped me clear my head and get a better sense of things. While I was on my lap about the dock, I felt a strange tremor in my soul. In an instant, the whole world went white and I was standing, nay, floating, in a sea of cosmic jam. I looked around and saw the whole universe and at the same time, nothing at all. It was a perplexing feeling that I still can't quite describe. It's like the end of a delightful dream just after you've woken up. You remember the feelings and some of the pictures, but just when you try to place it, its gone for good.
> I did what surely any wizard in his youth and hubris would do, I made some loud demands of whatever thing had put me in this state. Now I will tell you, the worst thing you can do is try to make demands of a primordial deity. I am amazed to this day that the old god Asgorath didn't devour me whole. In any case, Asgorath said a number of words, and I said fewer with each passing moment. The old god relayed his information, and I relayed my respect, such as it was. And then no sooner had it begun that we departed one another's company. 
> So I did as he said, I took the position at Halruaa University and such is as you find me today.

## Halruaa University

Following his time in Thay, Absalom took up a teaching position at Halruaa University focusing on the art of conjuration. Absalom attributed his new-found love for teaching to the ancient god Asorath, a claim that left many scratching their heads. Within Halruaa, Absalom's talent and patience with the students earned him a great deal of respect. Twice he was nominated to the position of archmage of Halruaa, and twice he denied it. Privately he is recorded as having said, "my time with Dragonsbane taught me one thing, power, no matter how insignificant, is the deadliest drug imaginable" (_Memoirs of Professor R. J. McGrath_ by Ronald J. McGrath, first edition, page 267).

Absalom continued to teach conjuration, eventually adding transmutation and illusion to his repertoire, for the next 30 years. During that time Absalom experienced significant loss in his personal life. Both his wife and two of his three daughters passed away due to an unexplained illness. Absalom searched desperately for a cure, and following their deaths, for a culprit, but both eluded him. It was following the death of his wife that a vacancy was left in the position of headmaster. Having lost confidence in his wizarding abilities, he readily took the position, expecting most of his duties to be administrative.

Absalom managed to be an incredibly successful headmaster. 90% of graduating classes became quite high-level wizards in their time. A disproportionate number of archmage were graduates of Halruaa University under Absalom's leadership. While Absalom had sought the headmaster position in an effort to escape, he soon took up teaching the occasional class, even offering regular tutoring sessions to students who needed it.  

## Downfall of Joab Dragonsbane

Since his exile, Absalom thought little of Joab Dragonsbane, and had worked hard to stay out of his way. While he urged students not to join the Dragonsbane's wizarding army, he equally urged them to not pick a fight with the dark lord. In this way he hoped to prolong the inevitable attack on Halruaa from the Dragonsbane. And the for 50 years (up to this point) Absalom had spent at Halruaa, this plan had worked perfectly. That is until Tashluta, a small merchant city west of Halruaa, published a writ of war against the Dragonsbane. While many nations and cities had done this before, most of them lay well north and were too well fortified for the Dragonsbane to consider an incursion. Tashluta however only had Halruaa between it and the Dragonsbane's hold in Dambrath.
